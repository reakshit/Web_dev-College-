Question:
1. My Short Bio (using basic tags):

Create a simple HIML page that displays your name as the most important heading (<h1>).

Below your name, write a short introductory paragraph (<p>)

Then, use a horizontal rule (<hr>) to separate this from a slightly less important heading (<h2>) titled "My Interests",
 followed by a short paragraph listing one or two of your interests.
